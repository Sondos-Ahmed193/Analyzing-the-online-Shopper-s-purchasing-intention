# Analyzing-the-online-Shopper-s-purchasing-intention
## Overview ##

In this project, I focused on the online shopping dataset, wherein I'm trying to draw insights from a customer's behavior on the site. I analyzed a number of factors, such as conversion rate and total revenue generated.
I also performed univariate and bivariate analysis while taking various dataset features into consideration, such as pageview duration, types of visitors, types of traffic, and browsers used. Then,I implemented the K-means algorithm and elbow method to find the optimum value of clusters, and visualized scatterplots based on this value. These plots, in turn, provided us with useful information so that I can plan.
