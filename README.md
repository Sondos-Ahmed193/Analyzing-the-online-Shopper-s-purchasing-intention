# Analyzing-the-online-Shopper-s-purchasing-intention
## Overview ##

During the last few years, with the rise of YouTube, Amazon, Netflix and many other such web services, recommender systems have taken more and more place in our lives. From e-commerce (suggest to buyers articles that could interest them) to online advertisement (suggest to users the right contents, matching their preferences), recommender systems are today unavoidable in our daily online journeys.
In a very general way, recommender systems are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users (items being movies to watch, text to read, products to buy or anything else depending on industries).

In this project, I focused on the online shopping dataset, wherein I'm trying to draw insights from a customer's behavior on the site. I analyzed a number of factors, such as conversion rate and total revenue generated.
I also performed univariate and bivariate analysis while taking various dataset features into consideration, such as pageview duration, types of visitors, types of traffic, and browsers used. Then,I implemented the K-means algorithm and elbow method to find the optimum value of clusters, and visualized scatterplots based on this value. These plots, in turn, provided us with useful information so that I can plan.

* Introduction

Dataset consists of 12,330 sessions in, 84.5% (10,422) were negative class samples that did not end with shopping, and the rest (1908) were positive class samples ending with shopping.
